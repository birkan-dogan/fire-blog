> In this project, I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js and Firebase to create this good-looking fully-responsive page 🎯.  
> I've used the advantages of React.js to manipulate the DOM efficiently 🎢.  
> I like working with Firebase to handle database tables for making CRUD operations, it was easy to manage 🤝.  
> Also love to use firebase-auth for authentication process. I am thankful to Firebase for providing us the social media auth, I really enjoy to use Google and Github auth in my project 🛡.  
> In CSS process, I've used pure-css and this made my css-skills powerful 🌌.  
> In creating and updating post section, I had a chance to work with **react-quill** package and it was really life-saver for editing text blocks 🤖.
